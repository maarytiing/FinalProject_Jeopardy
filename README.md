# Open Psychometrics Fictional Characters Ratings
### Final Project for Mary Ting 

For my Final Project, I chose a fun dataset based on crowdsourced fictional character analysis that I found through Data is PLural. I had first heard of this through a quiz on openpsychometrics.org a few months back. You answer 30 questions about yourself and the results show you what fictional characters you are most like. The quiz can be found here: https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/

They give you your results, here are mine.

Then ask you to analyze characters. Here's some examples.

The formulas I used were 

 =VLOOKUP(A4,'character index'!A1:C801,3, false)
 ```
=VLOOKUP(I$1,'trait index'!A1:E235,2, false)
```
